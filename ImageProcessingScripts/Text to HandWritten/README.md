## Description: 
Let's [**see**](https://github.com/Iamtripathisatyam/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/ImageProcessingScripts/Text%20to%20HandWritten/Text_to_Handwritten_Text.py) a Python script that will convert Text to Handwritten Text.

**Pytesseract**, sometimes known as Python-tesseract, is a Python-based optical character recognition (**OCR**) program. It can read and recognize text in photos, license plates, and other documents. To interpret the words from the provided image, we'll utilize the tesseract software.

**Pywhatkit** is a library that may be used for a variety of things, including sending WhatsApp messages, watching YouTube videos, searching Google, and writing handwritten text.

## Procedure to follow: 
- pip install **pytesseract**
- pip install **Pillow**
- pip install **pywhatkit**
- Visit and Install [**Tesseract**](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki); scroll down to find the latest installers for **32-bit** and **64-bit** systems; download them as needed.
- Load the image you want to convert.
