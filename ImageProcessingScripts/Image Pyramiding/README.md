# Image Pyramids
  
## Introduction<br>

* An image pyramid is a collection of images - all arising from a single original image - that are successively downsampled until some desired stopping point is reached.<br>
#### There are two common kinds of image pyramids<br>
## Gaussian pyramid<br>
* Used to downsample images<br>
* Representing image in multiple scales
* They are called pyramids because the processed image can be represented in form of pyramids of different size(2^n+1)

### How Algorithms Works? <br>
It works on Aliasing "Aliasing is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable ".<br>
Image I of size (2N+1)x(2N+1) Output: Images g <br>

<br>
The whole pyramid is only 4/3 the size of the original image.<br>
#### To	generate a Gaussian	pyramid, iterate	between	these	two	steps:	
* Smoothing: Remove high-frequency components	that could	cause	aliasing.	<br>
Smoothing	can	be achieved	by averaging	neighboring	pixels.	
The	strength of a	smoothing	operator is proportional to the	number of	pixels it averages.	
Averaging	can	be computed	as the Cross-Correlation of the	image	with a constant kernel,
Cross correlation in 1D can be computed using Matrix multiplication

* Down-sampling: Reduce	the	image	size by	Â½	at	each	level.



### Advantages<br>
* To make smoothed copies of images at different scales.
* highly redundant, coarse scales provide much of the information
in the finer scales

### Disadvantages<br>


### Applications <br>
* Scale	invariant	template	matching	(like	faces)	
* Progressive image	transmission	
* Image	blending	
* Used for multi-scale edge estimation
* Efficient	feature	search<br>
Some Good example of image blending <br>

# Laplacian pyramid<br>
Laplacian Pyramids are formed from the Gaussian Pyramids. There is no exclusive function for that. 
Laplacian pyramid images are like edge images only. Most of its elements are zeros. They are used in image compression. 
A level in Laplacian Pyramid is formed by the difference between that level in Gaussian Pyramid and expanded version of its upper level in Gaussian Pyramid. 


* Used to reconstruct an upsampled image from an image lower in the pyramid (with less resolution)<br>
* The Laplacian pyramid provides a coarse representation of the image as well as a set of detail images (bandpass components) at different scales.

### How Algorithms Works? <br>
Over-complete decomposition based on difference-of-lowpass filters;
the image is recursively decomposed into low-pass and highpass bands.
* Each band of the Laplacian pyramid is the difference between two
adjacent low-pass images of the Gaussian pyramid,<br>

### Advantages<br>
* Eliminates blocking artifacts of JPEG at low frequencies because
of the overlapping basis functions.
* approach also allows for progressive transmission, since low-pass
representations are reasonable approximations to the image.
* coding and image reconstruction are simple

### Disadvantages<br>


### Applications <br>
* A Laplacian filter is an edge detector used to compute the second derivatives of an image, measuring the rate at which the first derivatives change.<br>
* Laplacian operator is to restore fine detail to an image which has been smoothed to remove noise. <br>
* Applies a Laplacian operator to the grayscale image and stores the output image.<br>
