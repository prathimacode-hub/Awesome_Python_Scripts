Title: Facebook Messenger Automation

Short description of package/script: Here we will send the message in messenger auotmatically.Here we just need to open messenger in browser and then run the program.
Here with use of pyautogui and time library we can send msg easily.
In the program the message is written which can be changed as per requirement and we can also specify the number of times message to be printed.
(We can also use this program for spamming but I don't suggest that.)

List out the libraries imported: pyautogui ,time

Setup instructions: First we need to open messenger in browser and then we have to open chat with targeted person to whom we need to send message and then run the program.
Here in the script we had written the message(this can be customised) that is to be send and here we can also specify the number of times the message to be sent(if we need to send message multiple times) .
