Title: **Typing Speed Test

**Desciption** :There are 3 functions defined in the program one to find error , speed and time .So here we use time library for getting the starting and ending time.
For finding the error we will split each word and then check if any word is missing or not.For finding the speed we will get length of the correct word and then dividing it by time taken.
  

**List out the libraries imported**. 
 -> Time
 
 
**Setup instructions**:
We just have to run the program on our python IDE and then press enter and then we have to type the given sentence .
Explain how to setup and run your package/script in user's system

**Detailed explanation of script**
The code is simple and easily understandable .
In the code we have 3 functons for each method the functioning is different .For Error , we split the given sentence and match with the given one if there is difference than it will show the error.
For speed, we get the length of correct word written and then we divide them by time taken.
For time ,we take the difference of the starting time and ending time.

And at last ,we print all the functions showing the amount of error , average typing speed and time taken.

**Output**
Scrrenshots are added
