# What's Your Story?
I am sure the name intrigued you. This is a basic python script which will generate random stories.

## A short summary
The task is to generate a random story every time the user runs the program. I have stored the parts of stories in different lists, a part of the story from each list is selected with the help of _random.choice()_ and a random story is generated. To give a personalized touch, the user is prompted for some inputs.

#### Module used in the project 
random
#### Written as
import random
#### Use in the project
It is used to select the random story parts from the lists.

## Working
1. The program first prompts the user to enter a series of inputs.
2. Then they are placed in a premade story template using concatenation.
3. The story full of fun is generated.
