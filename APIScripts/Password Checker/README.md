# Password Checker
## Short Description:
**Imported Libraries:**
- requests
- hashlib
- sys


**Purpose:**
It's an actual tool that I use day to day for security reasons, not just any silly dumb password checker. This is legitimately going to be the most secure way for you to check if your password has been ever pawned or been under hacker radars.
