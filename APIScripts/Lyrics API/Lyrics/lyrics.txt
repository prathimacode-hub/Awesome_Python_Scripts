[Verse 1: Andy Shauf]
Alexander all alone
Smoking a cigarette
The last pack he’d ever buy
At least that’s what he said
He stood up to stretch his back
And fell down to the ground

[Verse 2: Andy Shauf]
Alexander all alone
'Till the neighbour caught a glimpse
Cried out for his wife
To call the ambulance
Alexander all alone
Felt them check his pulse
He heard them pronounce him dead

[Chorus]
Hell is found inside of me
And nothing else will set me free
If hell is found inside of me
Then open me up and spill me out

[Verse 3: Andy Shauf]
Alexander wondered why
No life flashed before his eyes
Why his soul did not depart
Why he found no peace of mind
Would it take a little while?
Was it the same for everyone?
Alexander realized
[Chorus 2]
That hell is found inside of me
And nothing else will set me free
If hell is found inside of me
Then open me up and spill me outEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
