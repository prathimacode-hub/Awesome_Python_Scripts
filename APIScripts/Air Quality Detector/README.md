# Air Quality Detector
## Aim:
As the pollution is increasing the air quality index is degrading now a days so for that we need to know the air quality index of a particular city so our script do that for us.
## Short description of package/script

Here we will fetch the air quality index using api and extracting it through json and request and then showing the result through tkinter. Here it will also show whether it is good or bad.
- List out the libraries imported are json ,request ,tkinter.
## Workflow
First we need to get our api key then through json and request we will fetch the data and we need to specify the city's name in the script itself.
## Setup instructions

Here for the usage of api we need to generate a api key from the website and then we just need to specify the city name for which we need to fetch data in the script and then output will be shown.
