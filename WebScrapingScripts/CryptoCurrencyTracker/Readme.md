I have used requests module to get the http data from the given url
then used bs4 module to extract the required information
After retrieving the data, used pandas module to handle loading and reading of data from csv files. 

This bot scrapes the url for every 10 minutes, get the latest data related to the coins and then adds the new data to the csv files
