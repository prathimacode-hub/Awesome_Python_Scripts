### MEMORY_PUZZLE_GAME

**GOAL**
This is a match game made using python's gaming module pygame.


**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- The program runs a memory game that allows you to turn over cards by clicking the mouse.
- Each grey box represents the image of an animal hidden by default.
- If there is a match, the two cards will disappear, leaving a blank white space and giving a message "MATCHED". 
- If not, they will flip back over.
