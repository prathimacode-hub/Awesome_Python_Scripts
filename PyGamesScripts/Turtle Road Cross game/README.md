## The Cross Boss!
#### An interactive single-player game where the player must help the turtle reach the other side of the road, by successfully dodging the cars.

- The turtle can only move forward.
- Cars appear on the screen at random intervals and move along the road from right to left.
- If the turtle reaches the other side successfully, the player is promoted to the next game level.
- The difficulty level increases progressively with the increase in the speed of cars on the road.
- The game is over when a car touches the turtle.
- Built using the turtle module in python.
