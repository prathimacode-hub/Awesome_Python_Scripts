# Package/Script Name
### **blackjack_game**
## Short description of package or script

<p>This is a simple version of the black jack game. You have given a list of two. When your card's total is greater than 21, it will be called black jack, and you will lose. If your card's total is less than 17 you have to pick a card. At the end, you will stop picking your card, and the game will end. It will show what cards the computer has. After that, whoever has the greatest number in total cards will win</p> </br>

<p> This project is made to use the concept of list and functions properly.</p>

# Setup
