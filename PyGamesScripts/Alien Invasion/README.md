#Alien Invasion
This project was created for me to have a better understanding of the python language 
and it's libraries, and for you to enjoy!
I wrote the game using the pygame library while downloading two BMP files from google.
**Purpose**
control the ship using the arrows on the kewboard and shoot down the aliens on screen
using the space bar.
The player has 3 lives.
each player has a score count
Once the player eliminates all aliens from the screen a new round will begin with 
faster aliens.
If the player loses, game will restart.
**Workflow**
I used the Sprite class in order to maintain the bullet, ship and alien objects 
with use of the collision detection method of the sprite class.
I used pygame in order to set up the game window and fonts with it's built in 
methods.
**Compilation steps**
In order to get the game running, run the alien_invasion.py file.
