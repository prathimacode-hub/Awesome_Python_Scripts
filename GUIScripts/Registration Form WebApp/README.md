## Overview:
With the help of the PyWebIO module, we'll create a registration form. This Python library is mostly used to build simple, interactive web interfaces locally. Username, name, password, email, and website link information will be entered into this form. In relation to passwords, it will also double-check your password to see whether it is accurate. Your phone number, website URL, and email address will also be verified.

## Form Elements
* **input_group**: Used to get the inputs in the group.
* **input**: Used to take all kinds of inputs from the user.
* **type**: This depends on user choice whether the user wants a number in the input or a text in the input.
* **required**: If required is true, that means you have to input something, we can’t leave blank.
* **validate**: Receives input as a parameter, when the input value is valid, it returns True.
* **cancelable**: Whether the form can be canceled. Default is False.
* **PlaceHolder**: This element is used only in the input_group function.
* **radio**: Only a single can be selected.
* **select**: You can also select multiple options by setting the “multiple” parameter to True.
