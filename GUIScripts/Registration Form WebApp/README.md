## Overview:
With the help of the PyWebIO module, we'll create a registration form. This Python library is mostly used to build simple, interactive web interfaces locally. Username, name, password, email, and website link information will be entered into this form. In relation to passwords, it will also double-check your password to see whether it is accurate. Your phone number, website URL, and email address will also be verified.
