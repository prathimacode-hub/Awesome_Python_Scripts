## Description:
- My project works on Event Handling.
- Event Handling In Tkinter Python means to bind the keyboard or mouse buttons to the Tkinter and use them to call some functions.
- For GUI we will use **"tkinter module"** because itâ€™s very easy to learn and use.
- We use **bind()** function to bind keys and functions to each other.

## Procedure: 
```python
from tkinter import *
```
- First after importing modules, we will then initialise tkinter
- After that we will set Height and width of the variables.
- Then we will set the title for **GUI** and geometry of **GUI**.
- After that we will define **me()** function which will tell how much time you have clicked.
- Then we will use **bind()** function which will bind left and right mouse button to root.
